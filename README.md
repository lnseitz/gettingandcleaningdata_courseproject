Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, through Coursera. The run_analysis.R R script downloads the dataset, loads all relevant information, merges training and testing datasets into one dataset, subsetting data with only mean and standard deviation values, creates a tidy dataset with the mean and standard deviation values for each activity and subject pair.

Tidy dataset is in TidySet2.txt.
